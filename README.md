# Reinforcement-Learning-based-Movie-Recommendation

**Recommender Systems** are the systems designed to that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Recommendations typically speed up searches and make it easier for users to access content theyâ€™re interested in, and surprise them with offers they would have never searched for. 


In this project work, we explore the use of **Reinforcement Learning based techniques** to solve the problem of **Movie Recommendation**.
We have implemented the following strategies : **Multi Armed Bandits** based recommender and an **Actor-Critic** based recommender framework using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
